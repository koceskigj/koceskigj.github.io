        <h3>Valentine's Day gift Cards</h3>
        <p class="italic">- Creating Valentine's Day gift Cards using Photoshop CS6 -</p>
        <p class="description">The idea for this project came out of nowhere basically. Usually I love to have fun in
            what I do
            and if possible, make others laugh too. The making of the gift cards was pretty much smooth and easy-going
            and if you ever are in need of an unorthodox way of inviting your potentnial Valentine on a date, check out
            these cards. Also, if you like them or have a simular way of seeing things, make sure to contact me and I'll
            try and make some more! :)</p>

        <p class="description">Remember those cozy Sunday evenings in the early 2000s when you'd gather up with your family
            in the living room and you'd countdown until 8PM to watch the brand new episode of "Who wants to be a Millionaire?"?
            Well, who doesn't, really?! You'd sit on your armchair whilst the others are sitting on the soft sofa wondering in awe
            of what would become another awesome expirience, shared with a lot of chanting & chatting. The vast majority of us did not get a chance
            to compete and have fun on stage, so it is my honour to present you a look-a-like quiz you can play together
            with your family and feel that adrenaline for one final time! :)</p>
